/**
 * Step 2: Plan Changes
 * 
 * This module takes the structured intent from the previous step and
 * generates a precise, machine-readable plan for how to modify the
 * email JSON object.
 * 
 * The output of this step should be a JSON Patch array, which is a
 * standard format for describing modifications to a JSON document.
 * 
 * TODO: Implement the logic for this step.
 * - This will involve a call to an LLM with a highly constrained prompt.
 * - The prompt will include the current JSON, the grid system rules (e.g., "column spans must sum to 12"),
 *   and the structured intent from Step 1.
 * - The LLM will be instructed to ONLY output a valid JSON Patch array.
